- add support for other shells (bash, ksh, sh, even csh and tcsh?)
- allow configuration at root of homedir, applying elsewhere (.ini style??)
- allow command-line based manipulation of configuration
- allow changes to track through subdirs, i.e. a change in /foo/bar
  still is left applied in foo/bar/baz, unless a new .cdenv file is
  found there
