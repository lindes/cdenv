# cdenv -- the main workhorse for the cdenv shell functionality.
#
# This utility will generate eval-able shell code to set various shell
# environment variables, etc.

# very rudimentary arg-handling at present.  Fortunately, we should
# normally be being called by our own function, and thus it shouldn't
# matter too much.  For now.  Later, we'll want to be much smarter
# about this, and allow various other options for debugging things,
# setting environments, etc.
mode = ARGV.shift
new = ARGV.shift
old = ARGV.shift

# until I actually do something good with these arguments, spew them to stderr:
STDERR.puts [mode, new, old].inspect

# the name of the old file:
oldfile = "#{old}/.cdenv"
# and the new one (could reference #{new}, but don't really need to):
newfile = ".cdenv"

# code for rewinding:
def backwards(line)
  STDERR.puts("Sorry, cdenv doesn't know how to handle: #{line}")
end

# code for playing forward:
def forwards(line)
  STDERR.puts("Sorry, cdenv doesn't know how to handle: #{line}")
end

# first, rewind any changes from OLDPWD:
if(File.exists?(oldfile)) then
  STDERR.puts("--=> Found a cdenv in OLD dir, rewinding it")
  File.open(oldfile).each do |line|
    backwards(line)
  end
end

# and then, play changes from this PWD:
if(File.exists?('.cdenv')) then
  STDERR.puts("++=> Found a cdenv in new dir, playing it forward")
  File.open('.cdenv').each do |line|
    forwards(line)
  end
end
