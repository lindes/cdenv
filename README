Inspired by some tools I've seen at companies past, `cdenv` is (to be)
a utility (or really, set of utilities) for managing changes to such
things as environment variables (though it's not limited to that) upon
execution of a `cd` command in the shell (change directories).

This can be useful for cases where you want certain environment
variables to change depending on what directory you're in.  For
example, if you've different source code projects that use different
versions of the same set of tools, cdenv can change your PATH (and/or
other relevant variables) such that when you cd into a particular
project's directory heirarchy, you'll be using the correct set of
tools.  (I've seen this used for changing compiler versions depending
on which source tree you're in, to use appropriate cross-compilers
and/or toolchains.  Recently, I've been motivated to finally write
these tools by the release of Rails 3, while I'm also maintaining
various sites that still use previous versions of rails.)

This utility is currently still in its infancy, nominally supporting thus far:

- zsh syntax for the following
- prepending an item to one's PATH, and then un-appending it when
  leaving the directory.

See the TODO file for the various things still needing to be done.
